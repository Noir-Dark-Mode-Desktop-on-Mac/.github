## About Noir Dark Mode
Noir Dark Mode for Mac is a powerful Safari extension designed to deliver a seamless dark browsing experience. It automatically generates dark themes for websites that don’t offer one natively, ensuring consistency across the web. By integrating directly with Safari, it runs smoothly and efficiently without draining system resources.  

Unlike basic dark mode plugins, Noir uses advanced rendering techniques to create visually balanced dark styles. This makes websites look elegant and easy to read, without broken layouts or color issues.  

Noir Dark Mode for macOS is highly customizable. Users can fine-tune contrast, brightness, and individual site settings, giving full control over the appearance of each page. Whether you prefer deep blacks or softer grays, Noir adapts to your personal style.  

The extension is also privacy-first. It does not track browsing history, sell user data, or insert ads. With continuous updates, Noir Dark Mode ensures compatibility with the latest macOS and Safari releases. It’s a reliable tool for anyone who wants a more comfortable and modern browsing experience.
